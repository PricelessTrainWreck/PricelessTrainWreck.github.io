What has really amazed me over the past year or so, is just how openly contemptuous of the backers everyone at CIG has become.

After this video i can only say one thing. This thing really turned into a scam. Maybe not as big as some people make it out to be. But this shit alone proves it and if someone can deny it or some up with a valid factual counter argument please be me guest.</description></item></channel></rss>
