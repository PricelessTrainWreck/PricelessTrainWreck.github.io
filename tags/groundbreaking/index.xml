       What has really amazed me over the past year or so, is just how openly contemptuous of the backers everyone at CIG has become. Jared will laugh on camera at their expectations of a finished game in a less than geological timescale, Sandi doesnâ€™t even bother to show up and half-ass justify her huge paycheck, and Chris mostly stays in hiding now.</description>

  VictorianQueerLit  I think the best part of the Star Citizen Scam finally collapsing is that a large number of nerds will stop psychotically obsessing over Elite Dangerous being THE ENEMY and instead maybe shut up and enjoy the game that delivers on many of Chris Roberts promises.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will always be people that refuse to play it because it dared to exist opposite of Star Citizen and ten years from now at any mention of Elite Dangerous they will scoff and go into a rage filled tirade about &amp;ldquo;Polygon Tacos&amp;rdquo; or whatever but I think that will be a small minority.</description>
