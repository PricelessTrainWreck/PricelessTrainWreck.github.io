   [PTU Bug Hunt] 30009 or 30006 errors.
Discussion
January 21st at 6:48 am
Greetings!
We need help tracking down another issue. The 3k9 or 3k6 errors are fairly common on live, are often associated with recovery and/or bed logout, and can be debilitating. However, due to account copy they frequently are under reported during the PTU cycle. If any of you experienced this issue, please post below and let us know if/how you were able to resolve.</description>

Reserved for all time greatest posts
        The one thing we should have learned by now is that time and Star Citizen makes fools of us all. The SC faithful have been so sure that total success is just around the corner for so long. And the SC skeptics have been so sure that total collapse has been just around the corner for so long.</description>
