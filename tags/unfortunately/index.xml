You don&amp;rsquo;t license an engine when you build an MMO. You especially do not license an engine when building an MMO that is supposed to be the world&amp;rsquo;s first AAAA game and will do things MMOs have never managed to achieve.
They have to build their own engine. Period. There&amp;rsquo;s no other way around it. Buying an engine is a waste of money because you&amp;rsquo;re going to throw it all out and start over anyways.</description></item><item><title>All Time Greatest Posts</title><link>https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2017-10-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2017-10-10/</guid><description>All Time Greatest Posts
