Greetings!
We need help tracking down another issue. The 3k9 or 3k6 errors are fairly common on live, are often associated with recovery and/or bed logout, and can be debilitating. However, due to account copy they frequently are under reported during the PTU cycle. If any of you experienced this issue, please post below and let us know if/how you were able to resolve.</description>
