This week I’ve accumulated over 5000 in pledges.
I kinda wish this was a joke but I have a genuine addiction.
I have no idea what I’m doing.
Please help.
My girlfriend is pissed about how much I spent on ships this week she said she may actually leave and went back to her parents. I had to tell her I ruined my credit and we can’t get a new apartment this year till I fix it</description></item></channel></rss>
