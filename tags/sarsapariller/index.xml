Jobbo_Fett    Incredifun is the dumbest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve heard all week.
   Sorry, it is IncredifFUD.
   Has anyone said Fart Poopizen yet
 The Titanic   I’m honestly shocked that CIG haven’t pulled the COVID-19 card yet, it would be the perfect excuse to kick the SQ42 can down the road for at least
a few months.</description>

Star Citizen : Interview de Dan Trufin au Bar Citizen de Liège 2020  According to Dan, refueling is more an activity than a full career. This involves buying fuel (or making it), possibly responding to a distress call, and transferring fuel from one vessel to another.
Chris Robert wants the connection between the ships to be visible . There will therefore be a pole as for supply planes.</description>

       What has really amazed me over the past year or so, is just how openly contemptuous of the backers everyone at CIG has become. Jared will laugh on camera at their expectations of a finished game in a less than geological timescale, Sandi doesn’t even bother to show up and half-ass justify her huge paycheck, and Chris mostly stays in hiding now.</description>

  You don&amp;rsquo;t license an engine when you build an MMO. You especially do not license an engine when building an MMO that is supposed to be the world&amp;rsquo;s first AAAA game and will do things MMOs have never managed to achieve.
They have to build their own engine. Period. There&amp;rsquo;s no other way around it. Buying an engine is a waste of money because you&amp;rsquo;re going to throw it all out and start over anyways.</description>

Bootcha  Hey gang.
So here&amp;rsquo;s a question.
Espresso Machine cost about $17,000.
Space Door cost about $40,000.
What single, used-once item would cost $100,000?
You&amp;rsquo;ve seen it. You&amp;rsquo;ve absolutely fucking seen it.
Aussies, you&amp;rsquo;ve absolutely fucking seen it.
 Bootcha   Surely not that weird outfit Sandi wore during the presentation in Pax Australia?
 What does your heart tell you?
   I can only assume that it&amp;rsquo;s the complete ensemble;</description>

  I think there&amp;rsquo;s 2 crowds on the SC subreddit - one that is all TRUE BELIEVERS that just post screenshots and praise CIG all day, and people just checking in on the development who are much more realistic. The former isn&amp;rsquo;t even posting in the roadmap threads, and the latter only post when there is development news. So when the sub goes back into fan mode, it&amp;rsquo;s just business as usual and the same people continuing to post what they&amp;rsquo;ve always posted.</description>
