VictorianQueerLit I think the best part of the Star Citizen Scam finally collapsing is that a large number of nerds will stop psychotically obsessing over Elite Dangerous being THE ENEMY and instead maybe shut up and enjoy the game that delivers on many of Chris Roberts promises.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will always be people that refuse to play it because it dared to exist opposite of Star Citizen and ten years from now at any mention of Elite Dangerous they will scoff and go into a rage filled tirade about &amp;ldquo;Polygon Tacos&amp;rdquo; or whatever but I think that will be a small minority.</description></item><item><title>All Time Greatest Posts</title><link>https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2017-10-10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2017-10-10/</guid><description>All Time Greatest Posts

The one thing we should have learned by now is that time and Star Citizen makes fools of us all. The SC faithful have been so sure that total success is just around the corner for so long. And the SC skeptics have been so sure that total collapse has been just around the corner for so long.</description></item></channel></rss>
