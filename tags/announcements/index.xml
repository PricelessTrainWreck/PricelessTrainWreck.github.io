I don&amp;rsquo;t think there was an ELE, but i do think CIG has been mortally wounded by 1000 self-inflicted cuts (and counting) over 2024. We&amp;rsquo;ll probably know by next week how dire the situation is. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying &amp;ldquo;90 days tops,&amp;rdquo; but the next few days are critical for Parp Citizen. Poor IAE sales could induce an unrecoverable flat spin.The passengers and crew of UEE Only Constant are justifiably nervous and upset.</description></item><item><title>December 2019 Set 1</title><link>https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2019-12-15/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2019-12-15/</guid><description>December 2019 Set 1
What has really amazed me over the past year or so, is just how openly contemptuous of the backers everyone at CIG has become. Jared will laugh on camera at their expectations of a finished game in a less than geological timescale, Sandi doesnâ€™t even bother to show up and half-ass justify her huge paycheck, and Chris mostly stays in hiding now.</description></item></channel></rss>
