This week I’ve accumulated over 5000 in pledges.
I kinda wish this was a joke but I have a genuine addiction.
I have no idea what I’m doing.
Please help.
My girlfriend is pissed about how much I spent on ships this week she said she may actually leave and went back to her parents. I had to tell her I ruined my credit and we can’t get a new apartment this year till I fix it</description></item><item><title>January 2020 Set 2</title><link>https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2020-01-15/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pricelesstrainwreck.github.io/post/2020-01-15/</guid><description>January 2020 Set 2
LMAO! Sorry none of this janky shit works after almost a decade, so here have a janky ass jpeg to look at.
the ship is the fix
they&amp;rsquo;re giving you a ship because it&amp;rsquo;s the only way to get past the fucking issue
What in the world is so wrong with this game that a fix is to log into an entirely different game mode and lay down in a bed?</description></item></channel></rss>
