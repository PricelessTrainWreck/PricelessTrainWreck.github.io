VictorianQueerLit I think the best part of the Star Citizen Scam finally collapsing is that a large number of nerds will stop psychotically obsessing over Elite Dangerous being THE ENEMY and instead maybe shut up and enjoy the game that delivers on many of Chris Roberts promises.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will always be people that refuse to play it because it dared to exist opposite of Star Citizen and ten years from now at any mention of Elite Dangerous they will scoff and go into a rage filled tirade about &amp;ldquo;Polygon Tacos&amp;rdquo; or whatever but I think that will be a small minority.</description></item></channel></rss>
