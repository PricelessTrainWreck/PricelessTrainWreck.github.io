<p>It’s hard to understand why anyone has faith in this game anymore. After raising $275 million from fans, the developers decided they needed even more money and sought out private investors.</p>

<p><strong>Money Won’t Fix This Games Eternal Development Hell</strong></p>

<p>The truth about Star Citizen is that it’s probably either never coming out, or that it’s not coming out for years and years to come. Different parts of the games keep getting changes, added or removed. Seeking more funds is just a sign that they’ve wasted everyone’s time and money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Cinematics Team began implementing the ‘interrupt’ tech mentioned in previous reports into the design sprint tasks for each applicable scene. This enables them to look at a scene and how it plays out before deciding on the time windows available in the performance that a player can interrupt or abandon. <strong>This determines whether the existing motion capture (mo-cap) is suitable or if additional animation work is needed.</strong> As most scenes are mo-cap based, the team must carefully assign breakout points to allow NPCs to react to the player abandoning them. Once the cinematics and level designers have added their interrupt markup, the animators break up the animation fragments, being careful not to lose interesting elements of the performance. It’s a fine balance, as too many interrupts create excessive work, but not enough could leave an NPC  referencing player absence in an unrealistic way.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the saga was, I believe, mid to late 2015 when CIG was responding in real-time to things this thread posted. There was a particular week or two where we were finding all their plagiarized art in-game and on their website, which, as the proof was posted, resulted in real-time patches removing the asset, or quick website updates removing the pics.</p>

<p>In a sense, that was the last time CIG engaged in, and responded successfully to, quality control.</p>

<p>I like to stay informed on the grey market prices in case I&rsquo;d found a good opportunity to get limited ships… But wow, I am getting concerned about the market consensus on the value of ships.

<blockquote>
<p>Russians often use video games and other weird and obscure markets and back channels to launder money in order to circumvent the sanctions that lock them out of mainstream international finance. Usually with video games it involves personal assets and in relatively small amounts, compared to businesses that have to find ways to hide much larger transactions. For the most part it’s too small time to warrant the attention of law enforcement and the intelligence community.</p>

<p>Roberts and Peterson both pools funding between each other, and from loans, to start up CIG and the Star Citizen project. Travel expenses, the first tiny LA office. I do think there was some payment of CryTek for the demo development, but exactly how much was paid is unknown to me. That being said, the first two million of the project&rsquo;s active crowfunding was most certainly NOT pumped in by Roberts. I don&rsquo;t know where that historical revisionism comes from.</p>

<p><strong>How is this even considered playable?</strong></p>

<p>I purchased the Avenger pack and I spent the entire day trying to play this game and got absolutely nowhere. I tried to quantum drive to a planet and it bugged out and crashed me into it. I try to land on Hurston and get put on autopilot any time I get get close to the landing pad. Then somehow I appear in the station and have to pay an impound fee, after having to walk 10 minutes to get to my ship. Then I try to do these distress signal missions. I tried 3 and each time I reach the waypoint absolutely nothing is there. I go and find this beginner guide, it tells me to go to Daymar mines to find this lost guy and mine some ore. After 40 minutes I dont find the guy but I finally find a rock to mine. I mine it and I go to pick up the ore. I cant. I cant even open My wrist hud menu. I cant interact with anything. <strong>I wasted an entire day trying my best to do literally anything in this game and got nowhere. I know its an alpha, but how is this acceptable? I&rsquo;m terrified to attempt anything else because every attempt I have made to do any kind of mission is an hour lost with nothing to show for it.</strong></p>

<p>Im just going to request a refund. I really wanted to like this game, maybe I just started at the wrong time. I cant bring myself to try again. Thanks for the replies, hope the game turns out great.</p>

<h2> Sandi Cashed Out? </h2>

<div class="poster">TheAgent</div>

<blockquote>
<p>so I guess Sandi really is gone</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Elliot **********</p>

<p>VP, Marketing at Cloud Imperium Games</p>

<p>May 2019 to Present</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have one very circumstantial shred of evidence in CR not wearing his ring on the last Pillar Talk which ever since the beginning of the project he has worn. We also have the history of Chris/Sandi&rsquo;s relationship repeating in cycles. At this point, it&rsquo;s a guess, but given history and what we&rsquo;re seeing at CIG, it&rsquo;s not out of the question.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some timing that&rsquo;s odd. Of the &ldquo;This wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen this way&rdquo; flavor.</p>

<p>2019 has one Sandi appearance in Jan, with CR and the matching Karthu racing shirts. Then in May 2019, Mr. Elliot comes in PWE and takes Sandi&rsquo;s position as VP of Marketing. Sandi is then seen in the UK filings as &ldquo;Appointment of Sandi Roberts as a director on 1 June 2019&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t see or hear of Sandi past that for the rest of the year, outside of one unverifiable anecdote that she was at an acting/movement class and a backer recognized her (reddit post deleted). Nearly a year later, we&rsquo;re looking at the possibility that both Sandi and Chris repeat the cycle of their relationship, going their own ways.</p>

<p>It feels like Sandi was pointed out as a weak spot by Daniel O&rsquo;connell Offner after his analysis of CIG was done, and the Calder bloc insisted that changes needed to be made for there to by any other money down the line. CR probably fought this because he felt he needed to, but at the end negotiated a demotion upstairs for Sandi to a directorship on the board. It&rsquo;s possible that the directorship role makes less money overall than what she made as VP of Marketing, but 2019 accounts haven&rsquo;t been filed yet so we don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>If I were to guess, Sandi felt betrayed by Chris, because she was removed by both him and the Calders from benefiting from the Calder injection. And that triggered the next part of the Sandi/Chris relationship cycle.</p>
