Civil Meat  I think there&amp;rsquo;s 2 crowds on the SC subreddit - one that is all TRUE BELIEVERS that just post screenshots and praise CIG all day, and people just checking in on the development who are much more realistic. The former isn&amp;rsquo;t even posting in the roadmap threads, and the latter only post when there is development news. So when the sub goes back into fan mode, it&amp;rsquo;s just business as usual and the same people continuing to post what they&amp;rsquo;ve always posted.</description>

      <description>All Time Greatest Posts
Reserved for all time greatest posts
      Buzz Aldrin  The one thing we should have learned by now is that time and Star Citizen makes fools of us all. The SC faithful have been so sure that total success is just around the corner for so long. And the SC skeptics have been so sure that total collapse has been just around the corner for so long.</description>
